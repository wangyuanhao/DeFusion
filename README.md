## DeFusion: a denoised network regularization for multi-omics integration

### Dependencies

Source codes of **DeFusion** are written using *MATLAB*, but we run preprocessing steps and downstream tasks in *Python*. The Cox Proportional-Hazards model is fitted by the *coxph* function in R.

*Python* 3.7.1

* scikit-learn 0.20.1
* numpy 1.15.4
* pandas 0.23.4
* rpy2 2.9.5

*R* 3.5.3

* survival 2.44.1
* survcomp 1.32.0

*MATLAB*

* [Similarity network fusion](http://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/SNF/SNF/Software.html)
* [Network enhancement](http://snap.stanford.edu/ne/)
* [npy-matlab](https://github.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab)

Note that the directories *Network_Enhancement* and *SNFmatlab* store codes downloaded from the official websites

### Work flow

![Workflow](https://github.com/wangyuanhao/DeFusion/blob/master/img/workflow.jpg)

### Data availability

* The data used in simulation study was generated by R scripts provided in [1]. 
* TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-KIRC, and TCGA-LIHC are publicly available at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/  and we downloaded from Data Release v13.0 (September 27, 2018).  The mRNA expression data matrices were constructed by HTseq-FPKM files and miRNA expression data matrices by miRNA expression quantification files. The DNA methylation matrices consisted of both illumina 27K and 450K data at level 3. 
* TCGA-KIDNEY was provided by [2]. 
* TCGA-LAML, TCGA-SARC, and TCGA-SKCM were acquired from http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/multi_omic_benchmark/download.html [3]. 
* We downloaded the external validation dataset--microarray gene expression profiles of 242 patients from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with access number GSE14520. 
* Data used in proteomics-and-phosphoproteomics integration was retrieved from supplementary data  in [4]

In seven TCGA cancer cohorts, we have tried to integrate mRNA and miRNA expression and DNA methylation corresponding to transcriptome and epigenome, respectively.

We also have tried to integrate genome, transcriptome, and epigenome using copy number estimate, mRNA and miRNA expression, and DNA methylation in TCGA-BRCA. In our paper, we have labeled this cohort as TCGA-BRCA~+cnv~. 

We have tried proteomics-and-phosphoproteomics integration by using proteomics and phosphoproteomics data of normal and tumor tissues.

### Pre-processing steps

* In TCGA cancer cohorts, paitents with missing survival information are removed.
* Features with over 20% missing values are removed in mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation data downloaded from TCGA.
* Missing values are filled with zeros in mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation data.
* Top 2000 most variant features are selected in copy number estimate, mRNA and miRNA expression, DNA methylation, and proteins and phosphoproteins' relative intensities.
* mRNA and miRNA expression are transformed by log2(x+1).
* Copy number estimate are normalized to the range of [0, 1].
* All features in proteomics and phosphoproteomics are divided by their maximum for normalization.

### Running examples

In the repository, we give three examples to show how to run **DeFusion**.

```matlab
[X, Z, E, convergence] = DeFusion(dataCell, lowDim, alpha, gamma, K, fout)
% @Input:
% dataCell: multiple data matrices stored a cell.
% lowDim: the number of dimensionality of latent sample representation.
% alpha and gamma: Parameters in DeFusion
% K: parameter for NE and SNF, usually set to be 20.
% fout: data path to save the output.

% @Output
% X: latent sample representation, a N x lowDim matrix. 
% Z: latent variables of features, a cell. 
% convergence: loss of objective function in each iteration, a structure array.

```

* A toy example

  > * run script 'runToyExample.m'  to attain latent sample representation.
  > * run script 'plotToyExample.m' for visualization.

* Integration of proteomics and phosphoproteomics data

  > * run script 'runProPhosphoIntegration.m'  to attain latent sample representation.
  > * run script 'visualizeProPhosphoIntegration.m' for visualization.

* Integration of transcriptomics and epigenomics data

  In this example, we fuse mRNA and miRNA expression and DNA methylation in TCGA-LIHC.

  > * run script 'runLIHC.m' to obtain latent sample representation.
  > * run script 'LIHC3CV.py' to train a Cox Proportional-Hazards model in  three-fold cross-validation.
