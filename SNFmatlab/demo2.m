%%%Load the data
load Digits_123.mat
%there are 4 types of features for 600 digits (1,2,3)

%%%First, set all the parameters.
K = 20;%number of neighbors, usually (10~30)
alpha = 0.4; %hyperparameter, usually (0.3~0.8)
T = 20; %Number of Iterations, usually (10~30)

%If the data are all continuous values, we recommend the users to perform standard normalization before using SNF, though it is optional depending on the data the users want to use. 

Data1 = Standard_Normalization(zer);
Data2 = Standard_Normalization(profile);
Data3 = Standard_Normalization(pixel);
Data4 = Standard_Normalization(fourier);

%%%Calculate the pair-wise distance; If the data is continuous, we recommend to use the function "dist2" as follows;
%if the data is discrete, we recommend the users to use chi-square distance
Dist1 = dist2(Data1,Data1);
Dist2 = dist2(Data2,Data2);
Dist3 = dist2(Data3,Data3);
Dist4 = dist2(Data4,Data4);


%%%next, construct similarity graphs
W1 = affinityMatrix(Dist1, K, alpha);
W2 = affinityMatrix(Dist2, K, alpha);
W3 = affinityMatrix(Dist3, K, alpha);
W4 = affinityMatrix(Dist4, K, alpha);


%next, we fuse all the graphs
% then the overall matrix can be computed by similarity network fusion(SNF):
W = SNF({W1,W2,W3,W4}, K, T);
%%%%With this unified graph W of size n x n, you can do either spectral clustering or Kernel NMF. If you need help with further clustering, please let us know. 
%%for example, spectral clustering
C = 3;%%%number of clusters
group = SpectralClustering(W,C);%%%the final subtypes information

%%%you can evaluate the goodness of the obtained clustering results by calculate Normalized mutual information (NMI): if NMI is close to 1, it indicates that the obtained clustering is very close to the "true" cluster information; if NMI is close to 0, it indicates the obtained clustering is not similar to the "true" cluster information.

displayClusters(W,group);

SNFNMI = Cal_NMI(group, label)


%%%you can also find the concordance between each individual network and the fused network
ConcordanceMatrix = Concordance_Network_NMI({W,W1,W2,W3,W4},C)

%%%according to this ConcordanceMatrix, you can find that, the first three
%%%data types contribute a lot to the final network, while the last one has
%%%less concordance with the last network.


%%%Here we provide two ways to estimate the number of clusters. Note that,
%%%these two methods cannot guarantee the accuracy of esstimated number of
%%%clusters, but just to offer two insights about the datasets.

[K1, K2, K12,K22] = Estimate_Number_of_Clusters_given_graph(W, [2:5]);
fprintf('The best number of clusters according to eigengap is %d\n', K1);
fprintf('The second best number of clusters according to eigengap is %d\n', K12);
fprintf('The best number of clusters according to rotation cost is %d\n', K2);
fprintf('The second best number of clusters according to eigengap is %d\n', K22);




%%%%We also provide an example using label propagation to predict the labels of new data points(see Demo2.m).
