This provides a matlab implementation of the paper: Similarity network fusion for aggregating data types on a genomic scale, Nature Methods, 2014.If you use any of this package, please cite our paper: B Wang, A Mezlini, F Demir, M Fiume, T Zu, M Brudno, B Haibe-Kains, A Goldenberg. Similarity Network Fusion: a fast and effective method to aggregate multiple data types on a genome wide scale. Nature Methods, 2014  You can run our code by Demo1.m and Demo2.mAcknowledgement:We used the following codes from others as follows: dist2.m function from Christopher M. Bishop. discretization.m from Jianbo Shi.We also modified the spectralclustering algorithm from Ulrike von Luxburg.For questions and comments please contact:
